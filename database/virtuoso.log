15:50:25 NOTE: Your database is using 32-bit prefix IDs in RDF_IRI
15:50:25 
15:50:25     This Virtuoso engine has been upgraded to use 64-bit prefix IDs
15:50:25     in RDF_IRI to allow for even larger databases.
15:50:25 
15:50:25     To take advantage of this new feature, your database needs to
15:50:25     be upgraded.
15:50:25 
15:50:25     The performance of your existing database should not be affected,
15:50:25     except when performing certain bulkload operations.
